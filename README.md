ðŸ§  Stack-Based Binary Radix Sort â€“ Sorting Algorithm in C

Developed a sorting program in C that implements an optimized radix sort using binary representation, designed specifically for stack data structures. The goal of the project was to sort integers using a limited set of stack operations, while printing the exact steps (operations) required to achieve the sorted result.

ðŸ”§ Project Features:
â€¢ Implements binary-based radix sort instead of decimal-based logic
â€¢ Sorts a list of integers using two stacks (stack A and stack B)
â€¢ Utilizes only allowed stack operations: push, swap, rotate, and reverse rotate
â€¢ Outputs a sequence of operations needed to sort the input efficiently
â€¢ Focused on minimizing the number of operations for performance

ðŸ›  Technologies & Skills:
â€¢ C programming
â€¢ Algorithm optimization
â€¢ Bitwise operations and binary logic
â€¢ Stack data structures
â€¢ Debugging and performance tuning in low-level code

This project strengthened my understanding of non-comparison-based sorting algorithms, binary manipulation, and how to solve problems with strict operational constraints.
